1.Abstract
**Life Line** is a LoRa-based emergency communication system for remote areas without cellular coverage. It enables users in wilderness areas to send distress signals via portable hardware. The system automatically locates victims using GPS, displays their position on Google Maps, identifies nearest help centers via Google Places API, and provides real-time monitoring through an admin dashboard. This solution bridges critical communication gaps in remote regions, enabling timely rescue response when traditional networks fail.
2.Problem Statement
In remote wilderness areas, jungles, mountains, and disaster zones, cellular network coverage is often non-existent or unreliable. When individuals face emergencies such as:
1.	Medical emergencies (injuries, animal attacks)
2.	Survival crises (food/water shortages)
3.	Navigation issues (getting lost)
4.	Environmental threats (extreme weather, natural disasters)
They lack effective means to communicate their distress and location to rescue teams. Traditional solutions like satellite phones are expensive, while simple distress signals (flares, whistles) don't convey location data or specific emergency types. This communication gap leads to delayed rescues, inadequate response planning, and increased mortality rates in remote emergencies.
3.Existing System 
Existing remote emergency systems primarily rely on satellite communication and specialized radio technologies. Satellite phones and Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) use global satellite networks (Iridium, Globalstar) to transmit SOS signals worldwide, but they're expensive, require subscriptions, and have limited battery life. Specialized solutions like WOKI-TOKI (wilderness communication devices) use long-range radio frequencies but have limited range (typically 5-10km) and lack automated mapping capabilities. Traditional methods include emergency whistles, flares, and signal mirrors, which are low-tech, weather-dependent, and don't transmit location data. All these systems suffer from either high costs, limited functionality, or inability to provide real-time location tracking and automated rescue coordination.
